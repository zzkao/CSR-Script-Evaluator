## Potentially Problematic Scripts

- 17 might require GPU and take up to 15h to complete with 8 GPUs
- 18 requires CUDA, which is some parallel computing architecture used by NVIDIA GPUs, suggesting the requirement of GPUs
- 19 requires CUDA, which is some parallel computing architecture used by NVIDIA GPUs, suggesting the requirement of GPUs
- 22 is not usable and requires manual dataset application and download. There are publicly available datasets that might be able to be downloaded with `wget`. We would need to manually write that bash command and update the script.
- 23 might require GPU. Also requires manual dataset download. Might be able to automate with `wget` and `zip`
- 24 some commands require GPU. Also requires manual dataset download. Might be able to automate with `wget` and `zip`
- 25 might require GPU.
- 26 might require GPU. Also requires manual dataset download. Might be able to automate with `wget` and `zip`
- 27 requires manual application for dataset
- 28 might need GPU but should be fine
- 29 requires GPUs and takes up to multiple days to complete with 8 GPUs. Dataset also requires manual download.
- 30 requires manual dataset download. Might be able to automate with `wget` and `zip`
- 31 requires manual application for dataset
- 32 requires manual dataset download. Might be able to automate with `wget` and `zip`
