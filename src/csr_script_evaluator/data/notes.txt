45: I've organized the commands according to the requested format and made the following adjustments:

    Grouped commands by their purpose (setup, data, training, inference, testing)
    Merged multi-line commands into single lines where possible
    Used default values from the README (e.g., subject IDs, clothing types)
    Included preprocessing steps under the testing section since they're required for evaluation
    Added comments to distinguish between different types of demos/training
    Maintained the exact paths and parameters as specified in the README

Note that some commands require manual intervention:

    SMPL model files need to be downloaded separately from https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de and placed in the correct location
    AMASS and CAPE datasets need to be downloaded separately from their respective websites
    The conda environment needs to be active for the Python commands to work

46: I've organized the commands according to the requested format and made the following adjustments:

    Grouped all commands by their purpose (setup, data, training, inference, testing)
    Used default values where possible (e.g., default model paths, demo prompts)
    Included all necessary setup steps including git submodules
    Added directory creation commands where needed
    Included both basic and advanced demo options
    Added the metrics evaluation command with default checkpoint path
    Maintained exact paths and parameters as specified in the README

Note that some steps require manual intervention:

    Model checkpoints need to be downloaded manually from the provided Google Drive link
    Dataset preparation requires downloading from external sources
    Some paths may need to be adjusted based on your specific setup

47: I've organized the commands according to the requested format and made the following adjustments:

    Grouped commands by their purpose (setup, data, inference, testing)
    Included both LRV-V1 and LRV-V2 setup and inference commands
    Used default values where provided (e.g., GPU ID 0)
    Added necessary directory creation commands
    Included evaluation setup commands

Note that some steps require manual intervention:

    Model checkpoints need to be downloaded separately
    Dataset files need to be downloaded from external sources
    Some paths need to be configured according to local setup
    The mplug-owl dependencies installation is not explicitly provided in the README
    Training commands are not provided in the README

The script assumes you have:

    Conda installed for environment management
    GPU support for inference
    Access to download the required model weights and datasets
48: I've organized the commands according to the requested format and made the following adjustments:

    Grouped commands by their purpose (setup, data, training, inference, testing)
    Included all training variations mentioned in the model table
    Added data download and processing commands
    Included visualization and evaluation commands
    Used default values where provided (e.g., scene0000_00 for visualization)
    Maintained exact paths and parameters as specified in the README

Note that some steps require manual intervention:

    ScanRefer dataset access needs to be requested through a form
    ScanNet dataset needs to be downloaded separately following their instructions
    Some paths may need to be configured in config.py
    The project root path needs to be set in lib/config.py
    Folder names for evaluation need to be replaced with actual training output folders

The script assumes you have:

    Conda installed for environment management
    CUDA support for PyTorch
    Sufficient disk space for datasets and features (~36GB for multiview features)
    Access to the required datasets
